# Method:
This project examines the Covid 19 situation in Israel, a world leading nation in the percentage of vaccinated individuals.
We are going to ask the following questions:
1) what is the relationship between the percentage of vaccinated individuals per city and the number of active cases?
2) What is the relationship between socio-economic status of a city and vaccination rate?
3) what is the relationship between minority populations and vaccination rates?

# First I loaded new case data, by date. 
new_cases <- read_excel(path = "Raw_data/new_covid_cases.xlsx") 

# Next I loaded vaccinated data, by date. 
total_vac <- read_excel(path = "Raw_data/number_vaccinated.xlsx") 
```

```{r}
# I then needed to join the two data sets. I plan to do this by date. I chose to
# begin with the new_case data as that was happening before the vaccine rates.

total_case_vax <- new_cases %>% 
  left_join(total_vac, by = "date") %>% 

# It makes sense that we are getting NA values, as vaccination only started a
